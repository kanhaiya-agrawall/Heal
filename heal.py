        This app helps you predict potential health issues related to diseases like **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, **Lung Cancer** and **Eye Disease** based on provided input data or CT image or retinal scans. Please note that these predictions are for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

        **How to use:**
        - For each health condition, provide relevant data or upload an image (for diseases like Lung Cancer).
        - Click on the prediction button to see the results.
        - Review the frequently asked questions (FAQs) in the sidebar for more information.

            "What should I do in case of a diabetic emergency?": "In case of a diabetic emergency such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), it is important to take appropriate action. For hypoglycemia, consume sugary foods or drinks to raise blood sugar levels. For hyperglycemia, monitor blood sugar levels closely, drink plenty of water, and seek medical attention (call 108 or 112 (India)) .",

Not everyone experiences these symptoms, and they can vary between individuals.",
            "What should I do during a heart attack?": "During a heart attack, it's crucial to act quickly. Call emergency services immediately (108 or 112 (India) or your local emergency number). While waiting for help, chew and swallow aspirin (if available) to help reduce blood clotting. Stay calm, and if you have been prescribed nitroglycerin, take it as directed. If you are experiencing chest pain, sit down and rest in a comfortable position. Avoid exertion or stress.",
